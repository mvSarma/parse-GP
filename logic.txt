State Machine:
1. The state machine waits in the first state (i=0) until the first character of the string to be parsed has arrived.
2. Once the first character has arrived, then the state machine goes to the second state (i=1).
3. In the second state, every character after the first character of the string is parsed.
4. If any character is skipped, then the state machine returns back to the first state.
5. If all the characters are seen once, in the second state, then the parse function returns true.
