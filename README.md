parse-GP
========
This project contains c++ code to parse for a string in a stream of characters.
If a string is input through command line, that string will be parsed. Otherwise "hello" will be parsed.
For now, the input is in a file called input.txt.
To obtain the stream from console, uncomment the line 109 and comment the line 110.
If you want to see the calculation time, uncomment line 8
