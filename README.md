parse-GP
========
This project contains c++ code to parse for a string in a stream of characters.
If a string is input through command line, that string will be parsed. Otherwise "hello" will be parsed.
This program supports multi word string also.
For now, the stream input is in a file called input.txt.
To obtain the stream from console, comment the line 9.
If you want to see the calculation time, uncomment line 8.
If you are bored of giving inputs, press CTRL^C. The program will handle it.
The doxygen html documentation is available in the .git folder.
The state machine logic explanation is avaiable in logic.txt
